# Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

My challenge was to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques I picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

###Approaches taken to optimize critical rendering path and performance
* added media query for css file for scenarios of max-width of screen was 480px
* removed online font
* added "async" tag to javascripts that did not impact DOM or CSSOM 
* minify css and javascript


#### Directory Structure

the index.html fild contains the game. The css folder holds the stylesheet. The images folder holds 
the sprite assets used in the game. The javascript (js) folder holds the game engine (engine.js), the games resource structure (resources.js), and the logic for the game itself (app.js)

#### Contributing

Anyone is welcome to re-use the code used in this project.
